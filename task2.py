# Variables and data types
# declaring variables: separate variable names with underscore. No key word for declaring?
character_name = "John"  # string
character_age = "35"
print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ", ")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old. ")
# changing the name halfway through, for example:
character_name = "Mike"
print("He really liked the name " + character_name + ", ")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + " years old.")
# variables are containers which allow us to store and organize all the data we have
is_male = True  # Boolean
Temperature = 98.6  # number/float

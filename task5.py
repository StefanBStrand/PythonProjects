#  Working with numbers:

print(10 % 3)  # Modulus (mod) operator. Returns the remainder from the division.

#  Inside the print parentheses we can do basic arithmetic.
my_num = 5
print(my_num)
my_num2 = 10
print(str(my_num2) + " My favorite number")  # Python will not concatenate a number and a string.
# The number has to be converted to a string
#  Function = a "collection" of code that does/performs something
